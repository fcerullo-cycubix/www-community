Dabei wurden bestimmte Funktionen von einem 3rd Party Entwickler entwickelt und vorab (unentgeltlich) der Allgemeinheit zur Verf\u00fcgung gestellt. Dies bringt jedoch ein gro\u00dfes Risiko mit sich: Was passiert, wenn eine Sicherheitsl\u00fccke in genau einer solchen Bibliothek entdeckt wird? Je nach Einsatz und Tiefe der Integration kann dies schwerwiegende Auswirkungen haben und je nach Verbreitungsgrad der Open Source Komponente kann es eine Vielzahl von Anwendungen betreffen.\nDas OpenChain Projekt hat genau dieses Problem erkannt und ein ISO-Standard entwickelt, der sich dem Thema Informationssicherheit bei Open Source Projekten widmet. Dabei bekommen sowohl Entwickler von Open Source Komponenten, als auch Entwickler die diese einsetzen und sogar Firmen, die Open Source Software vertreiben die M\u00f6glichkeit den Umgang mit Informationssicherheitsvorf\u00e4llen zu zertifizieren.\nDieser Vortrag gibt ein \u00dcberblick \u00fcber die Norm ISO/IEC 18974 und die damit verbunden M\u00f6glichkeiten seinen Kunden oder Anwendern ein sicheres Vorgehen nachzuweisen.\n\n**Bitte gebt Bescheid**, wenn ihr kommt und ggf. wie viele Leute ihr mitbringt, damit wir auch genug Platz haben.\n\nDu hast eine Idee oder willst auch einen Talk halten?

To stay ahead, we must rethink how we defend our systems, manage risk, and make critical decisions.\n\nIn Lead with AI, Marcus J. Carey explores how artificial intelligence can be a force multiplier for cybersecurity professionals. Drawing from real-world experience, he demonstrates how AI-driven tools can enhance threat detection, automate incident response, and augment human expertise\u2014without replacing the need for skilled defenders.\n\nThis talk will break down practical ways to integrate AI into security operations, from streamlining workflows to improving threat intelligence analysis. Attendees will gain a deeper understanding of AI\u2019s strengths and limitations, ethical considerations, and how to build AI-driven strategies that empower security teams rather than overwhelm them.\n\nAI is already shaping the future of cybersecurity. The question isn\u2019t if we should use it, but how we can lead with it.\n\n***Speaker:***\n**Marcus Carey**"

Although I have sat in on countless talks about empathy in the tech sector, the one thing ALL these talks miss is the language barrier when it comes to dealing with tech-savvy teams. If you are in a foreign country and cannot speak the language, it's going to be difficult to communicate regardless of the compassion in your heart. My unique art-&-technology background allows me to not only empathize with the strife of development teams, but helps facilitate a thriving pipeline of communication between security, developers and other hackers.\nIn this talk I will illuminate the perspective of a researcher participating in a bug bounty program, what to expect from researchers, and how to effectively escalate risks to development teams for remediation."

Not just to understand how LLMs work, but to see how easily I could break them.\n\nIn this talk, I\u2019ll dive into the security risks of Generative AI, particularly LLM chatbots, and explore vulnerabilities that are often overlooked. From sensitive information disclosure to prompt injections and jailbreaking, I\u2019ll walk through real-world examples showing just how these systems can be manipulated.\n\nNo tinfoil hat required.\n\nBio:\nBruno Morisson is a seasoned cybersecurity expert with over two decades of experience in offensive security, penetration testing, and red teaming. As the Partner and Offensive Security Services Director at Devoteam Cyber Trust, he leads world-class security testing across web and mobile applications, IoT, OT/SCADA, and threat-led penetration testing frameworks like TIBER-EU and DORA.\n\nBeyond his professional work, Bruno is a driving force in the cybersecurity community.

        "description": "G'day all,\n\nHappy new year! We're back into the swing of things. We found the \"Lean Coffee-style\" format worked well in 2024, so we're back with it once again as a place for AppSec practitioners to share their knowledge. We're looking forward to the AppSec discussions we had once again.\n\nWe're starting the year again at [YOI Indonesian Fusion](https://yoirestaurant.com.au/) as our location for April. On Wed, 2nd April 2025 6PM, there we shall meet. We aim to meet the 1st Wednesday every month from April to October.\n\n*There's NO BOOKING. If you're the first to arrive, please grab a table for the group and post a picture of the table's location in the comments of this meetup event. We'll use it to locate each other. (If you don't see a post, you're lucky first. Please grab us a table and post a pic. )*\n\n**Please remember to update your RSVP if you can no longer attend.** Even if it's just 30 minutes prior. It'll help whomever that arrives first know how big a table to get. We will take note of no-shows, and to make sure we've got space for those that do actually attend, your RSVP may be deprioritised for future events.\n\nSee you there.\n\nMore details on the format, and what to expect below:\n\n**The Practitioner's Roundtable**\nIt's a monthly meetup, for AppSec/ProdSec practitioners to participate discussing AppSec/ProdSec topics and share knowledge. There's no speakers, or sponsors; just a facilitator, with the expectation that you'll join the conversations. Broadly, the idea is that you're swinging by after work, for a regular catch-up with our peers over dinner (with F&B at your own cost) with a known format.\n\\-\\-\\-\n**So, what's happening?**\nThe format:\n\n1. At 6pm all attendees arrive, and order (and pay for) their own meals - we'll do the rest while waiting for the meals to arrive and as we eat.\n2. All attendees write down on a card 1-2 AppSec/ProdSec related topics they'd like to discuss.\n3. We'll all each cast 3 votes on the cards we'd like to discuss.\n4. We'll sort the cards, and discuss the topics with the top 3-4 highest votes. Starting with the topic with the highest votes.\n5. After 5(?) minutes, we all decide if we'd like to continue or move on to the next topic.\n6. If we continue, after 15(?) minutes, we all move on to the next topic of discussion.\n7. At 7pm, we wrap up and officially end. Before everyone leaves, we vote on the next restaurant that we'll meet at.\n\nThis is[ inspired by Lean Coffee](https://agilecoffee.com/leancoffee/), and intended for participants to be collaborators in the conversation focused on AppSec & ProdSec topics. *You are expected to participate in the AppSec/ProdSec conversations constructively if you attend*. This isn't the place for BizDev focused conversations.\n\nFor the location selection, here are the considerations we work with:\n\n1. It must be within 1 \"city block\" of the Melbourne Free Tram Zone.\n2. The typical price for a whole meal (without alcohol) should be under $50 per person.\n3. It must allow individual orders - you'd be ordering and paying for your own meal.\n4. It will need to have seating space for the group to say, just walk-in to the restaurant ( this may change if it grows beyond 10 regular attendees ).\n5. It must be quiet enough for us to have meaningful conversations.\n6. It must not be a restaurant we've been to in the past 6 months. (Just to keep things fresh )\n\nAlso, although we use the word \u201crestaurant\u201d this is used broadly to mean food establishment - if we\u2019re all keen on hitting up a decent kebab place, that works. As a courtesy to the venue, there's an expectation that you'd order something there."

        "description": "Gone are the days where you needed to have a coding background in order to create apps, automate processes, or reduce the need for manual tasks. Now, emails and communications are sent quicker, code is written faster, and applications are built en masse. Business users are enabled and empowered in ways we never dreamed of even 12 months ago. Thanks to the injection of AI into essentially every business productivity tool, from email to business intelligence to application development, business users are able to get more done without needing IT or dev teams to get involved. However, as is often the case, productivity and ease can come at the expense of security if not controlled properly. As people are brought closer to technology through the use of Gen AI tools and Copilots, security teams are facing difficult decisions on whether to clamp down on the use of these tools, or staring down increased likelihoods of data leakage and exfiltration. For a long time, security has been seen as a business blocker, but the introduction of Gen AI is forcing a reset on organizations that presents an opportunity for security to act as a business enabler."

It can be used to forge or decode packets for a wide number of protocols, send them on the wire, capture them, match requests and replies, and much more. This presentation will describe its main features step by step, and will give you hints to experiment by yourself.\n\n**Offensive security in the AI revolution**\nVulnerability research on the AI attack surface is not just important\u2014it is the thin line between innovation and catastrophe. The AI revolution has granted everyone unprecedented power, so the arm race is on between whitehat and blackhat actors. By embedding AI into the core of vulnerability research, we don\u2019t just strengthen digital defenses\u2014we redefine resilience. This presentation will explore real-world examples of how mainstream LLMs can be poisoned and will introduce the research currently being conducted in our lab to uncover weaknesses before malicious actors can exploit them.\n\n**\u200dAbout the speakers:**\n\n**Guillaume Valadon**\nJoining us remotely, Guillaume is a Cybersecurity Researcher at GitGuardian. He likes looking at data and crafting packets. In his spare time, he co-maintains Scapy and learns reversing embedded devices. Also, he still remembers what AT+MS=V34 means! Guillaume regularly gives technical presentations, classes and live demonstrations, and write research papers for conferences and magazines.\n\n**Dr. Emre S\u00fcren**\nDr. Emre S\u00fcren is a researcher at Cybercampus Sweden, the National Cybersecurity Research Center. As the manager of the Royal Hacking Lab, he leads research teams focused on LLM security, IoT hacking, threat intelligence, and memory forensics. In addition to his research, he teaches digital forensics at KTH Royal Institute of Technology."

        "description": "**Welcome to our OWASP Tampa 2025-March Lunch and Learn!**\nWe invite you to join us and members of our local Tampa Bay community to hear from industry experts in cybersecurity. This lunch and learn will bring topics that influence discussion among your peers and provide a venue to meet others that share your passions.\n\n**Agenda**:\n\n* 11:15am - Registration and Lunch\n* 12:00pm - Speaker - Chris Fago - AI is here for business users. What does that mean for AppSec?\n* 1:00pm - Depart\n\n**Speaker**:\nChris Fago is a cybersecurity sales guy at Zenity with a knack for pretending to be more technical than he probably should.\n\nAt Zenity he's focused on helping solve the emerging security challenges tied to AI agents and low-code development\u2014showing enterprises \u201cHow to fail at AppSec\u201d or what didn\u2019t work for others so they can close gaps often overlooked by traditional security tools in this new threat vector.\n\nPreviously, as a founding team member of Prisma Cloud (now part of Palo Alto Networks), he helped grow it into a market-leading CNAPP. During that time, Chris worked with major U.S. brands on complex digital transformations, helping them secure their cloud migrations and maybe even picking up a thing or two about Kubernetes.\n\nOutside of work, Chris loves spending time with his family, hanging out at Atlanta\u2019s botanical gardens and aquarium, obsessing over UFOs, and staying hopelessly devoted to Atlanta\u2019s sports teams (despite the emotional toll they consistently deliver).\n\n**Abstract**:\n**AI is here for business users. What does that mean for AppSec?**\nGone are the days when coding skills were needed to create apps, automate processes, or reduce manual tasks. With AI now embedded in tools like email, business intelligence, and app development, business users can accomplish more without relying on IT or dev teams. However, this boost in productivity can come at the expense of security if not properly managed. As Gen AI, Copilots, and Agentic AI bring users closer to technology, security teams face tough choices: limit tool usage or risk data leakage. Traditionally seen as blockers, security teams now have the chance to transform into business enablers thanks to AI.\n\n**Location**:\nGuidePoint Security\n3030 N Rocky Point Dr W,\nSTE 600\nTampa, FL\n33607\n\n**Sponsors**:\nZenity - [https://www.zenity.io/](https://www.zenity.io/)"

Anyone interested and enthusiastic about application security or security in general is welcome. All meetings are free and open. You do not have to be an OWASP member to attend our event.\nWiCyS aims to break down barriers and promote diversity in cybersecurity by empowering women and other underrepresented groups with resources for professional growth. Additionally, the organization is committed to creating a safer digital environment by supporting vulnerable individuals and advocating for inclusivity in the cybersecurity community.\n\n*What are we going to talk about?*\n\n* **AI and Machine Learning im Cybersecurity: Weapon, shield, or both?:** We are excited to welcome **Sara Rahimi**, Concierge Security Engineer at Arctic Wolf - who will explore the dual role that Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning play in the Cybersecurity area as a powerful tool for attackers and offensive purposes, also for enhancing the defense mechanisms and detection aspects.\n* **Web 3.0 security: same fundamentals, higher stakes** - **Dr. Gulnara Hein**, CISO at Chintai, will dive into how Web3, while introducing decentralization and new security challenges like smart contract vulnerabilities and irreversible financial losses, essentially reflects the same fundamental risks as in traditional systems. By focusing on core security controls, we can effectively address these challenges without adding unnecessary complexity.\n\n**Socializing Opportunities:** There will be plenty of time to socialize before and after the event.\n\n*Afterwards?* We will begin and conclude the evening with the opportunity to socialize at the venue with free food and both cold & hot drinks.\n\n*When?* Our Meetup takes place on **20.03.2025** from **18.00 to 22.00** o'clock CEST.\n\n*Where?* The event will be held at Arctic Wolf, located at 19th floor of Messeturm, Friedrich-Ebert-Anlage 49, 60308 Frankfurt am Main\n\n*Interested in giving a talk yourself?* Submit your talk here: [https://www.papercall.io/owasp-chapter-frankfurt](https://www.papercall.io/owasp-chapter-frankfurt)\n\n*And now?* Save the date, spread the word, and bring your friends and colleagues along to our event.\n\n*Follow Us!* Also, follow us on LinkedIn and refer to our OWASP Frankfurt site for information, including slides and recordings of previous presentations.
